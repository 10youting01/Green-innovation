Ned Bornholm Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Excellent financial results, great progress in operations and focused actions to address opportunities and challenges made 2004 a very successful turnaround year for Agent. After the company returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of 2003 we achieved consistently strong financial results and generated more than $700 million in cash in 2004. We completed a sweeping operational transformation, maintained the research and development investments that fuelled an outstanding year for new products, and improved our competitive position by entering new markets and exiting others. These results were delivered by Agent s 28,000 people, who have worked with great skill and energy under difficult conditions. We began 2005 a much stronger company than we were a year ago, and we are excited by our opportunities to build on 2004 s accomplishments. A leader in corporate citizenship Outstanding corporate citizenship has two main components, and both were important priorities for Agent in 2004. The first element is corporate governance the practices that bring to life the highest standards of integrity and transparency. The other element of citizenship is the role we play as an employer and community member. In 2004, we were proud to be ranked number 9 on the list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens published by Business Ethics magazine, which cited Agent s diversity practices and superior treatment of the community. During the year more than 6,000 Agent people volunteered in company-supported education, health and human service, and environmental programs or events 16 countries where we do business have active community programs nearly 273,000 students were reached through Agent-sponsored education programs and we improved our environmental performance by reducing our energy use by 6.3% and making significant progress toward tracking and eliminating hazardous materials from our products. This year we were formally recognized for our contributions and results in 22 communities worldwide. Our corporate citizenship efforts strengthen Agent s long-term competitiveness and help improve the viability of our many communities, and we will continue to make these efforts a priority.

At present, we track energy use our largest source of GHG emissions , including how much fuel oil and natural gas we burn, in terms of kilowatt-hours, joules and tons of Com emissions. In 2004, we worked to understand our primary sources of Com emissions, in addition to those emissions from our purchased electricity and natural gases. Based on this assessment, we will begin to quantify our emissions from sources other than purchased supply. Our goal is to build a complete inventory for tracking and defining future opportunities. Our highest GHG emissions come from our Semiconductor Products Group Business and are based on energy usage and perfluorocompound PFC emissions. Reducing the emission of PFCs, poses a technical challenge to semiconductor manufacturers because the quantity of PFCs used is increasing, and substitute chemicals are currently not feasible. Thus, more efficient usage and or abatement of these emissions is the roadmap to further reductions. For more information on efforts to reduce PFCs go to Reducing PFCs.

While we achieved an annual reduction of over 4%, a little short of our 5% target, this remains a significant reduction of 24.5% on 2000 levels. We have achieved these reductions by implementing energy use controls across our sites, such as temperature and lighting guidelines and sharing best practices of completed energy conservation projects among sites. We also track energy use across our operations on a kilowatt-hour per square foot basis to assess operational differences. Our energy usage per square foot increased this year by 7.8% from fiscal year 2003, while the total energy used in fiscal year 2004 was reduced by 6.3%. As we continued to consolidate space, we are better utilizing square footage at existing operations resulting in increased energy usage per square foot while decreasing our overall energy usage by exiting lower utilized locations. The result is that we continue to reduce our energy usage, but increased our usage per occupied space. In 2004, we built on the objectives and targets we set in previous years by e Adding detail to our definition of renewable energy sources.

We are also updating our internal energy policy to include continual improvement in the energy efficiency of our operations as measured by energy usage and cost. Indirect impacts and CO, emissions Agent s most notable indirect impact on the environment is through its use of purchased electricity. In 2004, Agent purchased over 550 million kilowatt-hours of electricity for its operations worldwide. Using regional emission conversion factors for the production of electricity and adding our natural gas and fuel oil consumption, this equates to a release of 308 million kilograms of Com to the atmosphere. This compares to 332 million kilograms in 2003 and 345 in 2002. This decline is due to both Agent s energy management programs and our consolidation of facilities.

Reduction of waste increases overall production efficiency thus reducing costs for Agent. Those savings can be passed onto customers. We have been working on strengthening the relationships between Agent functions that handle electronic waste.

In 2005, we are asking sites to commit to a 3% reduction of waste to landfill. One of the strategies to meet this effort includes reducing office paper consumption. In the past our paper consumption efforts have focused on managing proper recycling for the paper we generated. Now our plan is to reduce the amount of paper required. Agent continues to improve waste vendor performance and accountability through quarterly scorecards and meetings. We will further refine our contractor management requirements for electronic waste performance and accountability in 2005. The scorecard gives our sites an opportunity to rate various performance points with established targets for good, fair and poor performance. Once the scorecard is completed, we meet with our suppliers to work on improving performance and highlight areas of successes. This process allows us to reduce risks from suppliers operating at our sites in areas such as waste handling and emergency response. Did you know... Agent has won the 2004 WRAP award.

Spurred by customer interest and global regulatory changes, the effort includes systematic cooperation across our value chain to remove hazardous substances used in our products. Several factors are driving this change. In 2003, the EU issued two directives affecting the electronics industry. One, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Ross Directive, bans the use of heavy metals and two classes of brominated fire retardants in electrical and electronic products. The second, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE Directive, holds manufacturers responsible for ensuring that systems exist to collect and manage electrical and electronic products at the end of their useful lives through recycling and environmentally sound disposal. We have worked across our value chain to define needs and solutions for reducing and eliminating hazardous substances. Many of our products are exempt from the EU directives or subject to extended deadlines. We surveyed our customers, however, and learned that many of them prefer to purchase products free of the EU-identified hazardous substances. Did you know...

Lead-free initiative Lead is used widely in electronics for applications ranging from solder to finishes for printed circuit boards. In cooperation with the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative, we have identified acceptable lead-free component finishes. We have made substantial progress in eliminating lead from our products. Tracking and reporting Our direct materials suppliers are subject to our General Specification for the Environment GSE , which spells out the substances that must be avoided entirely or restricted to particular uses. Given the complexity of our supply web, however, a major challenge has been establishing the tracking and reporting systems to enable us to document the use or absence of hazardous substances in our products. We have helped lead an effort by the Electronic Industries Alliance to develop a joint industry guide and voluntary standard addressing hazardous substance reporting. This guide has helped establish a consistent system for reporting within our supply chain.

Beginning in 2003, Agent implemented a new process to identify, assess and manage potential EHS and social responsibility risks from our direct suppliers. Screening our supply base Our first challenge was devising a screening process to set priorities among our thousands of direct suppliers. We set up four screens 1. Chemical-intensive or labor-intensive operations 2. Agent orders worth at least US$50,000 per quarter for these commodities 3. Suppliers located in countries where EHS and labor laws are not robust or strictly enforced 4. In-depth evaluation to determine whether the supplier is certified to ISO 14001 and whether a supplier performance measurement review has been conducted. From this evaluation, suppliers were identified for an EHS and Social Responsibility Site Survey to obtain first-hand information. We also added company-wide strategic contract manufacturers to the list of suppliers recommended for a site survey. A total of 26 site surveys were conducted in 2004. Conducting evaluations and site surveys We began conducting site surveys in March 2004. The on-site visits used a questionnaire and an independent third party that performs on-site visits to gather information on EHS Management Systems and Social Accountability Emergency Preparedness and Response, Fire and Electrical Safety EHS Programs Labor Adherence to Agent s General Specification for the Environment.

We have already received comments on this year s Environment and Social Responsibility Report from Business for Social Responsibility BSR . Business for Social Responsibility comments on the Agent 2004 Environment and Social Responsibility Report January 2005 This is the fourth year in which BSR has provided feedback and public commentary on the Agent Environment and Social Responsibility Report. BSR has been asked to highlight strengths and weaknesses and provide suggestions for improvement in both reporting methodology and social and environmental performance. BSR s comments do not verify or express an opinion on the accuracy, materiality or completeness of the information provided in the Agent report. Rather, BSR s comments represent a perspective based on our experience in the field of social and environmental performance and on our familiarity with Agent s work to date. BSR commends Agent for continuing to produce high-quality social and environmental reports and for maintaining a strong commitment to corporate citizenship through its recent transformation. Agent s efforts over a number of years are now paying dividends in terms of improved social and environmental performance e Reductions in both energy use 24.5% since 2000 and Com emissions greater than 10% since 2002 are headline environmental achievements e BSR also welcomes the adoption and implementation of a code of conduct for labor standards in the supply chain. It is clear that Agent has not just made a policy commitment but is also making good progress implementing these standards with its first-tier suppliers e The Health and Safety data also shows notable improvements in reportable cases, injury illness rates and lost workdays e Numerous awards and achievements, such as being ranked number 9 in the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by Business Ethics Magazine and being selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. It is clear from these results that good social and environmental progress is being made at Agent. The report also contains a number of helpful innovations, including a detailed Global Reporting Initiative Index, a section focused on the specific needs of investors and an in- depth look at important issues such as climate change and supply chain labor standards. There is good consistency with the Agent Corporate Report, which includes a description of Agent s social and environmental performance highlights. However, there are a number of priorities for Agent if it is to continue to improve its social and environmental performance and strategy e Enhance its corporate citizenship management framework by more clearly publicly identifying and articulating its most important social and environmental issues, metrics and objectives e Take the implementation of its supply chain labor standards code of conduct to the next stage for example, through training and development of suppliers, investigating 125 126\",\n",

In terms of reporting, the current Environment and Social Responsibility Report contains a great amount of detail about Agent s activities, but could benefit from greater analysis and discussion e What are the highlights and lowlights, the key issues arising during the year and the main challenges ahead? How does Agent feel about its performance during 2004, and what are its prospects during 2005? E For investor audiences Agent could provide a business case, a description of key risks and opportunities going forward and an analysis of which social and environmental issues are of most material concern to Agent s future business prospects and why. In short, how does corporate citizenship help deliver the Agent business strategy? E Including more information on Agent s corporate social responsibility governance framework, such as how often the cross-functional Citizenship team meets, whether it reports to the Board, a description of its Charter or Terms of Reference and a summary of issues discussed e Agent rightly identifies that the use of its products and services represents one of its most significant environmental impacts. However, Agent can provide more information about how the use of its products and services can contribute to social and environmental progress and what strategies Agent has in place to maximize this contribution. Finally, as in previous years, BSR recommends that Agent reviews and presents its plans in relation to external verification and assurance.
